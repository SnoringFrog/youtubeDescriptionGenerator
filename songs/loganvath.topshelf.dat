Look in the air, it's a bird it's a plane 
it's my heart falling down like rain on a cold tin roof 
and I feel calm for the first time tonight. 
I'm thinking about missing another summer and the thunder 
that rolls while mind sails steady - lists and floats 
on the sea with the calm breeze accompanying me. 
Don't you ever think that I've forgotten 
cause' my care's still caught in everything you've got to give 
and all the things I haven't seen quite yet 

And I can hear my father say, 
"Gotta' prove em' wrong to win the game." 

So I'm taking some time for myself 
and drinking off the top shelf. 
A little reckless, but how else can I test this all out? 
And even the sharpest knife still bends, 
when it's pushed in from the edge. 
You can't abuse it, but ya' can't always use it as planned. 

And sometimes I find myself in binds. 
And I've gotta' use what I can find. 

I've got a sister I don't see so much of 
I see the sea so much, I can only think up 
the words best said to her in long letters. 
If we could sit down over a glass of wine 
I'd say, "it'll be fine, you've just gotta' wait your turn 
there's more beauty in your house than the pages of a magazine." 
Prayer, it ain't just for the faithful - it's for the broken down people 
that we see and be in the streets and all the times that are happening in between. 

But I can hear our mother say, "when you hit your knees - it'll come your way." 

So I'm taking some time for myself 
and drinking off the top shelf. 
A bit expensive, but how else can I test this all out? 
And even the sharpest knife still bends, 
when it's pushed in from the edge. 
You can't abuse it, but ya' can't always use it as planned.
