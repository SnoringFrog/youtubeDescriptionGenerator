Well apathy is my drug
And self-deprivation keeps me high
Strangely enough
I want more than
Just to get by 
And I don't want to sink in
Any poetic sense
I want to fight this thing
Just as hard as I can

So where are you?
Are you still in that bed and those ruffled sheets
Still waiting to defeat
Oh what has already been beat
So rise up and won't you meet me
Spirit man have you fallen asleep?

Well if self-pity is my crutch
Then I need to shut up and stand up
I have been
I've been begging like a hurting dog
And I'm a man
I'm a well heeled man
Oh and I don't want to sink in
In any poetic sense
I wanna I wanna fight this things
And jump off this fence
Jump off this old fence

So where are you?
Are you still in that bed and those ruffled sheets
Still waiting to defeat
Oh what has already been beat
So rise up and won't you meet me
Oh spirit man have you fallen asleep?

And I'm refusing to become refuse
I'm strong willed but I'm willing to lose
(?) that got a loose hold on my soul
And it's stupid 'cause I've been held down by nothing at all
And I've been on a raft that's been sinking sinking
And I've been thinking thinking
That I need to get back 
I need to get back to where I belong

So where are you?
Are you still in that bed and those ruffled sheets
Still waiting to defeat
Oh what has already been beat
So rise up and won't you meet me
Oh spirit man have you fallen asleep?

So rise up and won't you meet me
Oh spirit man have you fallen asleep?
