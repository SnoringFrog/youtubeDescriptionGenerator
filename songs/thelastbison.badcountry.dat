Into the greater unknown
Where sea and sky
With grace collide
To wash on the shores that we own
They bring to life
The brothers' pride

Hoah,
I feel the wind
I feel the wind is blowing south again
South again to the bad country
So it begins
So it begins we're going down again
Down again to the bad country

Lines from our hands to the sea
We pull them in with burning skin
We climbed to the roots of the tree
To feel the wind
Lets go back again

Hoah,
I feel the wind
I feel the wind is blowing south again
South again to the bad country
So it begins
So it begins we're going down again
Down again to the bad country

Scorched by the blazing sun
Burned to the falls we run
Into the dark we dive
Coming alive

Hoah,
I feel the wind
I feel the wind is blowing south again
South again to the bad country
So it begins
So it begins we're going down again
Down again to the bad country

Hoah,
I feel the wind
I feel the wind is blowing south again
South again to the bad country
So it begins
So it begins we're going down again
Down again to the bad country

Hoah,
I feel the wind
I feel the wind is blowing south again
South again to the bad country
So it begins
So it begins we're going down again
Down again to the bad country
