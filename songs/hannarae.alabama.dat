You keep everyone at arm's length
Your thoughts are locked up in a box in a bank
Like a Rubik's cube with no solution
Or the planets without revolution
The road is empty and the night is endless
The seatbeat holds you (?) shaking and your breathless
Each mile passed marks a memory
Escaping who you used to be
Escaping who you used to be

Where do you leave your heart
In a different city every night
Where do you leave your thoughts
They're in a different state of mind
No things have never and will never be the same
Since Alabama changed you 
Oh oh oh
Since Alabama changed you
Oh oh oh

And you know you're like flipping a coin
You're a gamble (?)
While you're way up in the air
Oh the ground the ground patiently awaits
Oh the ground the ground patiently awaits

Where do you leave your heart
In a different city every night
Where do you leave your thoughts
They're in a different state of mind
No things have never and will never be the same
Since Alabama changed you 
Oh oh oh
Since Alabama changed you
Oh oh oh

It's not that you mean to live behind steel walls
Oh you let nobody in
It's just the way which the sea has taught you
Not to sink but to swim

Why do you leave your heart
In a different city every night
Why do you leave your thoughts
In a different state of mind
No things have never and will never be the same
Since Alabama changed you 
Oh oh oh
Since Alabama changed you
Oh oh oh oh
Since Alabama changed you 
Oh oh oh
Since Alabama changed you
Oh oh oh oh
