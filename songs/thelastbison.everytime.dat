Oh woah woah
Oh woah woah

(?) of it all
I (?)
Storm through quiet halls
It's my fault
There's paintings on the wall
I thought

Every time I look back, every time I look back
You are standing there casually aware of me
Every time I look back, every time I look back
You are waiting there holding out your hand for me
Every time I look down, every time I look down
You are sitting there waiting on the floor for me
Every time I look down, every time I look down
You are waiting there opening the door for me

Oh woah woah
Oh woah woah

Comes in like the tide
Low high
It's there then out of sight
It's day and night
Your well in morning time
All right
Then you're out of line
So I hold tight

Every time I look back, every time I look back
You are standing there casually aware of me
Every time I look back, every time I look back
You are waiting there holding out your hand for me
Every time I look down, every time I look down
You are sitting there waiting on the floor for me
Every time I look down, every time I look down
You are waiting there opening the door for me

Every time I look
Every time I look back

Every time I look back, every time I look back
You are standing there casually aware of me
Every time I look back, every time I look back
You are waiting there holding out your hand for me
Every time I look down, every time I look down
You are sitting there waiting on the floor for me
Every time I look down, every time I look down
You are waiting there opening the door for me

Oh woah woah
Oh woah woah
Oh woah woah
