What is all this? The question I am asking
It's not what is I feel like I was promised

This hurts, this leaves a lasting laceration
I can't believe that this is what my faith was for

The scars remain
Reminds of pain
The scars remain

When I see you, I see scars that are matching
When I see you, I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling, you are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you, I see scars

My feet will sink in this quicksand around me
Unless something or someone comes to save me

This hurts, this leaves a lasting laceration
I can't believe that this is what my faith was for

The scars remain
Reminds of pain
The scars remain

When I see you, I see scars that are matching
When I see you, I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling, you are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you, I see scars that are matching

When I see you, I see scars that are matching
When I see you, I see scars that are matching
I know what I'm feeling, you are feeling scars remaining through
When I see you, I see scars that are matching
