I can feel it in the thunder rolling, lightning crashing
It's our time, the wait is over
Fire's burning, floods are rising
It's our time, the wait is over

Sitting in ashes, we're broken, 
with our faces downward,
Like there's nothing we are looking forward to

We've been waiting so long
For this moment all of our lives
Let it pour out

I can feel it in the thunder rolling, lightning crashing
It's our time, the wait is over
Fire's burning, floods are rising
It's our time, the wait is over

Hoping and praying in silence, 
That the blessings of the former 
isn't the end of what we look forward to

We've been waiting so long
For this moment all of our lives
Let it pour out
