I'm in need of retribution
Or at least some saving grace
And I have lost all my conviction
I've been buried with no faith
If I came across as apathetic
I apologize
I was begging for forgiveness
After yelling "crucify"

Breaking down, building up
Trapped inside a vicious cycle
Desperate now, no one to trust
Stripped of my self righteous title
Father father, please forgive me
I knew not what to do
I only followed with the motion
To what I thought was true

I crawl through the dirt again
I reach for the sun to shed my skin
I gained it all, but what's the cost?
'Cause all I've felt of late is loss
And all I've done till now is run
So terrified of what I've done
But if there's one thing I know I know
It's that I can never seem to grow

Cause I've been drowned in all kinds of spiritual waters
And I build my bridge across them all to find my Father
And I was chased by all my demons in the darkness
I was lost and cold and callous
I became so heartless
With (?) behind me I take one step back
And I'm gone forever
I can't believe I used to think that I was so clever
So dig me out
I can't believe this is happening
A sea of doubt
Won't you just let me begin
And God plant me in the garden
Watch as I don't move at all
I'm feeling so small
So small, God

I'm not afraid to try
Oh but I don't want to waste my life
And I'm not afraid to die
It just seems I cannot find the time
Every time I swell it all goes to hell
So God just rip me from the garden
I have no fruit to show
It's impossible, impossible to grow

Oh God it's (?) let it go
I can't ever know
If I will ever grow
