Hello consequence, so wonderful to see you again
you have not shown your face 'round here since the last time i was in
too deep. Now I've been struggling to sleep, and I have to blame that on what I have created. 
Always with women or drinks, some repetition of things, it's a tired old cliche but that does not mean that it ain't the truth - 'cause I have been absent from you and I have never felt less careful. 
Need my father, my mother, even my brother to say, "gotta' get your act together, do not rewrite the days - you can still be productive without all the hate, just need to remember who you once were." 

And I once was, quick on the draw
I once did, admit all my flaws
I once was an honest man and I held your hand when you had it bad
I once was fresh like the sand, 
my head moved steady and so did my hands
I once was, blessed and true until the day that I lost you

Goodbye meaning, I have been searching too hard to find you now like some bone in a yard, 
and i'll keep digging, but only when I have the time 'cause this world's been moving quickly - too much rhythm and rhyme
sometimes you've just gotta' do what makes you feel good 
and remember the nights that you still understood
how to be free, how to answer to no one
how to trust like a lover, and how to lie like a son
you say this world has got you down, honey, welcome to the club
I can hardly save enough money to go and see those I love
and we've all but lost it, we're all out of touch
i know we've missed hope a bit, babe, but I hope not to much

We once were thicker than thieves 
we once were so much easier to please
we once were alive on the tracks, when the wheels came down you know I had your back
We once were, younger than now
we once were all still just plotting it out
we once ran circles 'round squares just for fun
we were louder then, before we gave up.
