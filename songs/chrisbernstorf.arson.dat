So hold your breath and open your ears up wide
Because these words are gasoline and I brought the matches
Beneath the glow of marlboro lights smoked by men who look past one another
Arguing about when the town was really founded
Counting the ageless bricks to themselves like sins or stars or hail marys

You'll find me
A rusted out burned barrel
Corroding into the cracked pavement of an alley
Planted like a tombstone
Beside a strip club and a foreclosed shoe store
Caddy corner to an exit door someone welded shut
And a fire escape that couldn't hold anyone

Look inside me
You'll see used condoms and dirty needles
Chop sticks and fitness magazines
A rag doll and a scale model of the Eiffel tower
Going up alongside a couple of beer bottles bought with someone else's tithe money
And yesterday's newspaper
The leg of a dresser twice painted over sticks halfway out 
And leans on a family photo album that didn't survice the divorce 
And half the headboard of a dead son's bed

If the thought of what you might metaphorically be breathing in is making you uncomfortable, don't worry
I'm just being honest
I'm a whole lot of things being made new
Some of it's gonna take some time
Might need to burn all the way down to unidentifiable ash
And be tossed into the bay and sink to the bottom
And wait a few decades
Get dredged up again and used to fertilize a garden
Grow some cherry tomatoes or some squash or zucchini
Out of old TVs on a rooftop overlooking a mural of men hammering AKs and glocks into plows

But trust me, it's all getting redeemed
Every single bit of it
And so now, I'm just trying to tip myself over
Roll down any street God lets me
Spew my flaming guts onto anyone I can
A spark or a tornado or a hurricane of flames
Trying to catch a porch or a house or a subdivision
A block or a city or a county or a nation
Or just a single person on fire
Watch him burn
Pray that he bumps into all his friends
And spreads that fire like a rumor made of STDs and the flu
That he catches the neighbors' house on fire
Sits down for dinner and catches the tablecloth and then the whole family on fire
Or plunges himself into a crowded subway station
Or a congregation or a convenience store 
Or a deserted Pacific island or the NASA building
The FDA or the CDC or Hollywood
Or Ann Arbor or onto every desk in my alma mater
Or into the wheat fields outside of town
Burns down blocks then acres and them miles and timezones and continents

So go ahead pick up a piece of me if you're curious
Let the coal be pushed onto your lips
And maybe you can taste what was given
The spark that was first put inside of me
Let it touch your teeth
Let it's song sing through your jawbone
Climb up into your ear
Run your synapses like a ridgeline in a Colorado wildfire
Maybe you'll even be able to commisserate with the rocks
Understand a tiny portion of what they have been keeping up inside
The hosanna they've been singing since the Creator first left His fingerprints on their edges

This is arson
Not for revenge or the insurance money
But simply because we need it, and I want it now
Coat myself in napalm and juggle fireworks while skipping through a charcoal factory
Fill my sneakers with black powder and run through all the oil refineries
Lightings matches like it's my job
Because it is.

I wanna hear the volcanoes harmonize with this fire 
And watch the Father's breath flow through the blowpipe into us
Elongating and spinning and curving us
Until we are one enormous, obsidian cathedral
Vortexing in a celestial crescendo
Molten light taking shape over and over
Burning clay in the potter's hand 
Becoming the final pot, the final body, the bride
More and more

I wanna see the fire and sing its hymns
Bellow it's poetry to praise the Father and fan the flames
If this room's a stabalized all-oxygen environment
Then I wanna smoke all of my cigarettes at once
If this world's tinder
California with no rain for months
Then I wanna be the flower girl at the wedding
Tossing gasoline for rose petals
And the ringbearer too
Handing the single match to the groom
And he's got a thing for flames
Yeah this is arson
'Cause I've got this fire shut up inside my bones
That I am weary of keeping in
If I have my way I hope you burn
