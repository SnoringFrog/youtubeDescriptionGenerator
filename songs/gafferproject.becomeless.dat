Which would you rather be, 
The branches or the roots of the tree? 
Are you selfish or selfless with your love? 
Are you being held or holding others up? 

Mine is a generation of cowboys and adventurers. 
My friends and I, build rafts to float down the Mississippi. 
We dive 20000 leagues holding on to stones in our hands. 
I’ve hunted the great white whale all my life, 
But I’m not yet sure of what it looks like yet. 
Which would you rather be, 
The branches or the roots of the tree? 
Are you selfish or selfless with your love? 
Are you being held or holding others up? 

Every generation has had a great struggle, 
Be it war, famine or plague. But not us. 
Our only struggle is the fact we have no struggle. 
Oh it’s been longer than I can remember sense 
I got home and felt truly satisfied with my day’s work. 
Which would you rather be, 
The branches or the roots of the tree? 
Are you selfish or selfless with your love? 
Are you being held or holding others up? 

I am not worthy in the least of all the steadfast love 
And all the faithfulness that you have shown to your servant, 
For with only my staff I crossed this Jordan; 
and now I have become two companies.
