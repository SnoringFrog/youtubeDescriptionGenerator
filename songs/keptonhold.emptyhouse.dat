Four months going on five since you said a thing
I doubt you'd care to change that
Why fix what you don't think is broke?

She always hated my "I miss you"s
She said, "You say that all too much"
And now I guess sometimes I'm scared I still do

This time I won't let it get away with mine
My best intentions prompted your reaction to be fine
And just fine
Where does it go while I'm away?
All your affection you swore was just for me

I'll get along like an empty house
Just waiting to find out
If they're ever coming back for me
You grew up, moved on to your own thing
You say you're happy so here's to hoping

I've been trying to figure out why seasons change
And how come nobody ever stays the same?
Where does it go while I'm away?
What happened to every word she wrote when she swore I was her someday?

I'll get along like an empty house
Just waiting to find out
If they're ever coming back for me
You grew up, moved on to your own thing
You say you're happy so here's to hoping
Life 
Treats you better than I
I could ever do
Cause you're gone and I'm stuck here with these songs

Three years going on five since you said a thing
Why would anybody change that?
Why fix what you don't think is broke?

I'll get along like an empty house
Just waiting to find out
If they're ever coming back for me
You grew up, moved on to your own thing
You say you're happy so here's to hoping
Life treats you better than I
I could ever do
Cause you're gone and I'm stuck here with these songs

Stuck here with these songs
