Here I am 
Here we are 
Looks like I made it through 
Another year 

I'm still not sure who I should be 
I don't know what you've planned for me 

but I know it's good 
know it's good 
know it's good 
I know it's good 
know it's good 
know it's good 

I'm movin', I'm movin' on 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on 

I'm movin', I'm movin' on (but I always say that, don't I?) 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on (but I always say that, don't I?) 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on (but I always say that, don't I?) 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on (but I always say that, don't I?) 

I'm movin', I'm movin' on (but I always say that, don't I?) 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on (but I always say that, don't I?) 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on (but I always say that, don't I?) 
I'm movin', I'm movin' on (BUT I ALWAYS SAY THAT, DON'T I?)
