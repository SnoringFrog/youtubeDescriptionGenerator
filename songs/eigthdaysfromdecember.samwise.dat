(?) and take a step outside
(?) and it's clouding your (?) and mine
(?)
Let the nicotine (?)
(?) around your throat and chokes you (?)
(?) in your stomach

Running back inside (?) covered by the fire
It only burns the eyes and makes the tears fall faster
The sense of loneliness is a haunting apparition
For the floorboards creak louder when the house is empty
Never felt so scared 
Never felt so alone
There's a ghost of paranoia haunting your broken soul

So take a breath love
Let out a scream
Until your voice goes to hell
Pour fire and brimstone on me
Wrap your arms around me
Sink your nails beneath my skin
Take it out on me darling
It gets better I swear

We never planned it to be like this. 
This is not what we intended.
We never planned it to be like this. 
This is just how it is.

I can't force you to believe in hope 
I can only show you my love, His Love
So when the fire gets down on the carpet and spreads like blood 
Through an IV tube
And makes its way up to your room where you're laying there
With no ambition to make your way out

I will kick in the door
Run up the stairs
Just to tell you that I'm here that I'm close that you're not alone
In this cruel dark house 
That you're far too precious
To die by yourself
Oh I may burn
But yes I'll burn with you
When I feel your pain sting my entire being
No thoughts of leaving you alone will cross my mind
From the start I knew this would hurt
But I'll do it anyway
I will take you by the hand
Break my fingers if you most
Just don't let go
Don't give up the hope
It's now my time to walk with you
Through this burning mansion
It's a long way through
If we make it out alive
Fire's here to take us 
I will stay by your side
I will stay by your side
I will stay by your side
Oh
I will be your shoulder to cry on
I will be your shoulder to cry on
So much dirt and blood and (?) 
It was spilled for me
I will spill it for you too
For you too
I will spill it for you too
Oh
Oh
Oh

I will never leave you or forsake you
Because true love never left me
