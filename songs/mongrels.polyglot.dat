Your tongue sheds it's skin so easily 
How can you keep everything in line 
Can you remember all the nuanced lies? 

How can reality survive 
When your tongue twists it's fabric 
So lightly as you speak 

Your open mouth annihilates 
As swiftly as an atom bomb 
I can't make sense of what you say 
What pours from your mouth 

Is it honesty or lies? 
Is it black or white? 

Your tongue sheds it's skin so easily 
How can reality survive 
When your tongue keeps adding strands 
To it's web
