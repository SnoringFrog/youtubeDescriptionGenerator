Nearly 10 years I've been working hard
Blistered feet and broken hands
I've worn my fingers to the bones
Never a question or a doubt
Of everything left behind to live without
I've walked a straight and narrow road

And if I have to break my heart then I'll break it again
Lost count of all the sleepless nights I spent
Trying to find the perfect melody
Sometimes I feel like I'm too dead to carry on
Sometimes I wonder if it's write or if it's wrong
I just can't rest until I find another song

No no no

Some might say it's my first love
Gave everything up I couldn't get enough
I set my feet on this endless walk
I spend my days just passing time
Between the last chorus and another line
When it comes I come alive

And if I have to break my heart then I'll break it again
Lost count of all the sleepless nights I spent
Trying to find the perfect melody
Sometimes I feel like I'm too dead to carry on
Sometimes I wonder if it's write or if it's wrong
I just can't rest until I find another song

So I'll scream till I can't sing
And play until blood on the strings
Cause it's all I know
Until this page can hold no ink
Until the pen falls from my fingers
I will write these songs

And if I have to break my heart then I'll break it again
Lost count of all the sleepless nights I spent
Trying to find the perfect melody
Sometimes I feel like I'm too dead to carry on
Sometimes I wonder if it's write or if it's wrong
I just can't rest until I find another song

No no no
