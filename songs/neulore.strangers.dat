Blank lines on the pages
Where my heart should have been
Some things (?)
Takes time to unravel
(?)
Once the words come out (?)

But even when I feel you move
And I know you're here
We're strangers in an empty room
I watch you disappear
Ooh
I'm sorry that I ever said "I love you"

And I'm afraid of the mirror
Scared of who I've become
Can't see who you are
(?) 
Stones broke me open
I was a house made of a glass
It was a flood of emotion 
We were bound to crash

But even when I feel you move
And I know you're here
We're strangers in an empty room
I watch you disappear
Ooh
I'm sorry that I ever said "I love you"

Thunder and lightning
I'm realizing
Can't rewind time back
Let's just talk about it
(?)
(?)
Can't rewind time back
Let's just talk about it
Thunder and lightning
I'm realizing
Can't rewind time back
(?)

'Cause even when I feel you move
And I know you're here
We're strangers in an empty room
I watch you disappear
Ooh
I'm sorry that I ever said "I love you"
