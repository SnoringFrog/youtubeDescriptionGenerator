Maryland, Halifax 
A little girl is dead and she’s not coming back. 

Punching another hole in the bible belt 
I poured it out and drank it up again. 

Feel my severed soul 
Fizzing down the core of my bones. 

I spoke too fast and now I’ll never be whole. 

So stop it now, see that there is no one sinking 
but the swarm will blind us all. 

Don’t pray to god for me 
‘cause when I will, it won’t be me.
