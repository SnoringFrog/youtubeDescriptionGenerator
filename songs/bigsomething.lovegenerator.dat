Heart is beating faster to the rhythm of a drum
When we cross our wires together 
You can feel the power turning on

We are just machines
But we can feel like human beings
Can you feel the love we are generating?

Feel the love we are generating
Feel the love we are generating
Feel the love
Robot love
Robot love
Feel the love

Well the world is spinning faster and faster 
Its the innovation they're forever after
Let the circuits run and the meters spin
Feel the rhythm within the rhythm 

And we create the android pulse
Our mainframes changes and our eyes light up
You can feel the love we are generating
