Time is never wasted only spent well
Or somewhere else
And I can't help but feeling elsewhere
Since you showed me you were someone else
It's not right
You promised me forever
And I count you can't deliver
So you wrote if off as just a season

Was it your plan to act till you believed it?
Did you really think it wouldn't hurt so bad
When you sold yourself on leaving?
And I know I tried to make it work
And that's the trouble too hard to start a fire
Is sometimes we get burned

Time is never wasted only spent well
Or somewhere else
And I can't help but feeling elsewhere
Since you showed me you were someone else
It's not fair
You wished that things were different
You made it clear it's not the distance
That kept your heart away from mine

And was it your plan to act till you believed it?
Did you really think it wouldn't hurt so bad
When you sold yourself on leaving?
And I know I tried to make it work
And that's the trouble too hard to start a fire
Is sometimes we get burned

I told myself that it was worth the risk
I forced myself out of being nervous
I told myself that it was worth the risk
I forced myself out of being nervous

Well was it your plan to act till you believed it?
Did you really think it wouldn't hurt so bad
When you sold yourself on leaving?
And I know I tried to make it work
And that's the trouble too hard to start a fire
Is sometimes we get burned

Was it your plan to act till you believed it?
Did you really think it wouldn't hurt so bad
When you sold yourself on leaving?
And I know I tried to make it work
And that's the trouble too hard to start a fire
Is sometimes we get burned
