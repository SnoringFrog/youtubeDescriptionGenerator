Jesus!!! Make me an infinite supernova!
I want to be a light so bright
that they can see for hundreds of thousands of millions of billions of trillions of miles
so far they have to use those BIG scientific words that I don't know so well.

Jesus, make me Your light so they can see
what You've done and still do for me.

Jesus, make me Your light so they can see
how You've saved me, how You've changed me,
how You've saved me from hell in this life
and eternity as well.

Jesus, make me Your light so they can see
when I was deep down in pits of sin so deep and dark,
I couldn't tell myself from the sin,
that You didn't just stand up there on high, all like:

"Well hey man, I, uh, I love you a lot. You know, I hope you make it out ok."

No, no, no!! None of that! Jesus make me Your light
so they can see how You came right down in there,
wrapped Your arms around me, pull me right on outta
there, made me whole and complete in You.

Jesus, I will be whatever
size light You need me to be:
I'll be the supernova
or a lighthouse or a big ol' searchlight,

or, if you need something smaller Jesus,
I'll just be a little taplight, or a penlight,
or one of those cool little racecar keychain flashlights
my parents got me for Christmas--

Just please, Jesus, make me Your light,
Just please, Jesus, make me Your light,
Just please, Jesus, make me Your light,

and let me shine,
let me shine,
let me shine.
