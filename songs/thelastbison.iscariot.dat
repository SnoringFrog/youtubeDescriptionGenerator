Woe unto you 
Double crossing the Son of Man 
For in the dish you have dipped your hand 

Lo you come here 
To deliver the deliverer 
From simple kiss into tainted hands 

Iscariot, Iscariot 
The devil has you now 
Youâ€™re set up for betrayal 
Iscariot, Iscariot 
The devil has you now 
Your kiss tastes like a crown of thorns 

I have used, I have used 
Your unbelief, to set them free 
So die now, die now my Judas
