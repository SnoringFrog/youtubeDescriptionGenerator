Sleeping in another state
I’m wide awake, It’s half past sometime
I can’t see any sign of slowing down
I just can’t shake these waking dreams 
Of never living up to be
Everything I promised that I could

I don’t know how to expect
All of this to work out in the end
It’s not just you I’m scared of letting down
I feel I’m on the edge of something
But I’m still waiting on the mark for the gun to sound
Sometimes I wonder if it ever will
Sometimes I wonder if it ever will

I know we only get one chance
To make our lives worth something bigger than
The cost it took to get us there
My eyes are set and my heart is sure
I’m not asking for a place I didn’t earn
I just want to leave the starting line

I heard the path to greatness lies
In blood, sweat, tears, and countless nights
But how many ‘til you miss the point?
I don’t want to spend my life
Just waiting on the chance to come alive
But will I ever feel like I’ve arrived

I know we only get one chance
To make our lives worth something bigger than
The cost it took to get us there
My eyes are set and my heart is sure
I’m not asking for a place I didn’t earn
I just want to leave the starting line
