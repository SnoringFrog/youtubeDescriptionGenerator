My life is such a tragic story
I was born to be a poet
Before I lost my tongue
(?) from miles and miles away
From a home where no one cared they just took and never gave
(?) but I don't know anymore
(?) see the end of what I'm fighting for
This isn't love.
Go home my lady, nothing's set in stone
(?)
I guess you're right if by that you mean (?)
(?) perfect people
Looking for something inspirational worth repeating
My life is like a record spinning in circles
(?) the needle in the grooves
(?)
(?) so beautiful
(?)
I've got a light in my hand
And yet here I am
Struggling to get where I'm going
I've got a light in my hand
And still here I am
Struggling to get where I'm going
I've got a light in my hand
Yet still here I am
Struggling to get where I'm going
Struggling to get where I'm going
Get where I'm going
