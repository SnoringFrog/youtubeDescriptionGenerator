You crowd around me on the floor
You're staring and observing
Seeing what i'm fighting for
It's not in you, not like this
I'm only seconds away from giving in, and I'm running out of time
Now I'm running away to free my mind
My mind
It's so like you
Indiscretion is all you can be
Screaming to see what is in between
I've been to hell and back
The quiet never lasts
Its not like you to take risk
I’m only seconds away from giving in, and I’m running out of time
Now I’m running away to free my mind
My mind
With only seconds to go as we leave this world
With only seconds to go…
Corrupt the kill
We test a world that is broken
Don’t give in
As time slips through our fingers
It slips away
We test the words that are spoken
Don’t give in
Our final hour will linger
Too little too late
We test a world that is broken
Don’t give in
As time slips through our fingers 
It slips away
We test the words that are spoken
Don’t give in
Out final hour will linger
Too little, too fuck’n late
You’re too late
The time we spent is frayed
Gone away
I’m only seconds away from giving in, and I’m running out of time
Now I’m running away to free my mind
My mind
With only seconds to go as we leave this world
With only seconds to go…
Corrupt the kill
We test a world that is broken
Don’t give in
As time slips through our fingers
It slips away 
We test the words that are spoken 
Don’t give in
Out final hour will linger
It slips away.
