Went out today down to 5th and Main 
And bought me a new pair of shoes
Trying to escape all these broken dreams
And outrun the shadow of you
Coulda done better
Coulda done worse
I shoulda done nothing at all
The way your kiss brought me to the edge
It set me up for the fall

Cause I was born with a restless heart
And fever in my lungs
Trouble's done it's work on me
Maybe I should have known
I'm sinking like a stone
Sinking like a stone

So much for being open hearted
So much for caring at all
Take a chance and you hope for the best
But then everything you do goes wrong

I was born with a restless heart
And fever in my lungs
Trouble's done it's work on me
Maybe I should have known
I'm sinking like a stone
Sinking like a stone

I took one step too many
And ended up out on my own
I've been (?) for too long

Well the sun sets on good and evil
Rain falls on everyone
Good men keep count of their sins
While the rest of them put (?)

Cause I was born with a restless heart
And fever in my lungs
Trouble's done it's work on me
Maybe I should have known
I'm sinking like a stone
Sinking like a stone

I'm sinking like a stone
Sinking like a stone
