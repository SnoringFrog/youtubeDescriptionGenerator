City sits alone
Full once now disowned
?
Bold and overgrown

Prey 
That is what she’s become
Enslaved 
Chained to the broken one
The dust is finally settling
You know this changes everything
Let’s run to a place we can hide
The walls have finished crumbling
The thieves have done their plundering
Let’s hide in any place we can find

Royalty dethroned
Stronghold to the stones
Your city fell into the hands of foes
Quickly overthrown

Prey 
That is what she’s become
Enslaved 
Chained to the broken one
The dust is finally settling
You know this changes everything
Let’s run to a place we can hide
The walls have finished crumbling
The thieves have done their plundering
Let’s hide in any place we can find

Sing to me
Sing me the song you wrote
While I was still asleep
Compassed by dark and deep
Bring to me
Bring me the rope you tied
While I was underneath
Holding with all of me

The dust is finally settling
You know this changes everything
Let’s run to a place we can hide

The dust is finally settling
You know this changes everything
Let’s run to a place we can hide
The walls have finished crumbling
The thieves have done their plundering
Let’s hide in any place we can find
