The Chozo chose thousands of years ago to install a permanent exhibit
Fifty thousand pieces of rock art now nestle next to craters in a desert where the Navy designs and tests grenade launchers and cruise missles
Sun scorched in this viewerless gallery their thin white lines remind me of a local piano rock band that broke up after 5 starved years of basement shows and van sleeping
Some performing artists I know, 
A troupe named something about a hippo, and elephant, and a train wreck
Still tour, living in a tent and beating on their rusted saws and the busted washing machine they got for free if they hauled it

A particular chat book 
The product of a bowler-hatted Hungarian man with a mermaid tattoo
Who read at the public library on rainy Tuesday last October
Hurdles through my mind, thin and maroon
Like a painted arrow towards its target
A clay brown deer, here
A metaphor for truth

The man went by two initials like Elliot
Who's gone down at the man who strung the world together on paper and plagarism
The very best architect plumber heavy equipment operator salvage crew Mr. Fix It we had at the time
But still we only got fragments on ruins
A laconic visual of the stereotypical view of modern art
That still illicits spews and snorts of
"Stupid! Bunk! Just say what you mean already!"
From much of the same species that all of it was designed to reach in the first place

Yet when it hits
When the startling clarity of a white goat scratched on the shady side of a rock formation in the Mojave
Sticks a 21st century suburban kid in tight jeans and SPF 48
Makes him consider time and space and the endeavors of man
How God has gifted such an undeserving species
Then it all comes back to Hovell
And the fact that sitting around speculating if an action will have an effect
Is the only way that it surely won't

Comes back to clenched fists and prayer
And working the pavement
Back to molotovs and Bic pens
On the subway cars to the minimum wage that's funding the next revolution
Back to not selling nothing 'til after you're dead
Back to barbaric ? both virtuoso and in drop D
Back to trusting God and swinging away through hell and high water and whatever comes next
Back to soul
Back to the ? of freedom 
Redoing ? as the third of May
Sans press release, sans artist Q&A and afternoon lunchen social
Back to the ruler perfect shafts of light in that abandoned Amtrack tunnel
Illuminating the deafening decibels of his paint

Back to the persistance of cement songs
Which is the persistance of stone songs, ink songs, lyric songs
The persistance of rising, of spreading
Of small sparks that don't know their own size
Or what the world has to say about their particular potential
Sparks ignorant of statistics and theories 
Sparks without hands to wring
Or scales to weigh the pros and cons of failing
Sparks that simply burn and burn and burn
And burn with all they have
Cause they've been created for that alone
