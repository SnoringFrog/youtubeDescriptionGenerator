Your time is done, I'm moving in
I've come to fight or lose, so go ahead and try me
You know I've just begun, just begun

[Chorus:]
You've never seen a fight like this before (Like this before)
I take you down and leave you there wanting more (More)
You've crossed the line that I cannot ignore (Cannot ignore)
You've never seen a fight like this before (Yeah)

Feel the pain, I'm raining down on you
You won't deny my will, cause what I start I will follow through
Craving all that I can see
Making something out of me

[Chorus:]
You've never seen a fight like this before
I'll take you down and leaver here wanting more, more
You've crossed the line that I cannot ignore, cannot ignore
You've never seen a fight like this before

[Chorus]
