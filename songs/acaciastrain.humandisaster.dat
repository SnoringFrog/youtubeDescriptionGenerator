Rest in piss
Clutch your heart
Breathe in dirt
Rest in piss
Enough food for the rats to feast
No goodbye
No farewell
Rest in piss
You tainted the water
The world would tray you like a martyr
Fucking waste of time
You deserve to die
Liars lye
No chance to say goodbye
No fingerprints,
No face.
Gone without a trace
Their air is refreshing
Pulling out your intestines
Lips on the dirt
Blessed by the worm
Swallow your teeth
Down in your tears,
Lose yourself in sleep.
Surrender to your fears
Nowhere to run
Nowhere to hide
Glad you died happy
Happy you died
Last gasps from a shallow grave
Soak up the dirt
Pushing up daisies
