We tried to sleep up in the banks of snow
But soon discovered it was far too cold
So we then retreated into town
To ﬁnd a place where there was level ground

Oh
Call home

Oh oh Switzerland
You've taken way my breath now once again
You've left me with a sense of compassion
For the ones who
Can't pick them selves up off the ground

Oh Switzerland
I never thought I'd have you as a friend
I’m praying it was not at all pretend
I need you now
To help pick me up from off the ground

Our drinks were hardly worth the price we paid
But we thanked God for them anyways and
With five minutes left we broke our backs
To spend more money than either of us had

Oh
Call home
