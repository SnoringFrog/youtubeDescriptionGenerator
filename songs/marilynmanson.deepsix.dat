[Verse 1:]
You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You'd better watch yourself"
You want to know what Zeus said to Narcissus?
"You'd better watch yourself"
"You'd better watch yourself"
Yeah

[Verse 2:]
It's like a stranger had a key, came inside of my mind
And moved all my things around
But he didn't know snakes can't kneel or prey
Try to break the psyche down
Yeah

[Pre-Chorus:]
It's as if my feathers were wax
And your artillery lead
Do you like our bed?
Do you like our bed?

[Chorus:]
Deep six, six, six feet deep
Deep six, six, six feet deep
Yeah

[Verse 2]

[Pre-Chorus x2]

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]

[Bridge 4x:]
Love is evil
Con is confidence
Eros is sore
Sin is sincere

Sin is sincere
Sin is sincere
Sin is sincere

[Chorus]

[Verse 1]
