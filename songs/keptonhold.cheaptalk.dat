Just because we talked
Doesn't mean that we talked
Doesn't tell you that I'm fine
Surface level afterthought
I have not
Been okay with the fact that you're okay with the fact
That we've been growing apart quite a lot

I'm gonna try my best
To forget we were ever more
Than cheap talk and cheaper reasoning
It's not what I had planned
I'm not what you had in mind

Just because we tried
Doesn't mean that we tried
So why don't both of us feel all right?
This kept me up at night a lot
Did you not
Think about all the times we talked about all the times
You said we gotta be worth a shot

I'm gonna try my best
To forget we were ever more
Than cheap talk and cheaper reasoning
It's not what I had planned
I'm not what you had in mind
To regret we were ever more
Than cheap talk and cheaper reasoning
It's not what I had planned
I'm not what you had in mind

And it hurts to know
That this time it's you
Who feels so far away

I'm gonna try my best
To forget we were ever more
Than cheap talk and cheaper reasoning
It's not what I had planned
I'm not what you had in mind
To regret we were ever more
Than cheap talk and cheaper reasoning
It's not what I had planned
I'm not what you had in mind

What you had in mind
