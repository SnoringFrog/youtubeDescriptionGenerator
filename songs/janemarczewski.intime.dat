I will surely grow in time
I will surely grow in time
I will surely grow in time
Oh I will surely grow in time

I finally found me
At the edge of the sea
Where the tide had washed away all my charades

Humanity
And the ugly side of honesty
I am not the one I thought I'd be by now
By now

I will surely grow in time
I will surely grow in time

I will reach for the North Star
I (?) for the sun
I will (?)
To help me find my way back home

I (?) for the (?) this time

I will surely grow in time 
I will surely grow in time
Oh I will surely grow in time
I will surely grow in time
