As time went on, I opened my eyes
You never really knew me
You don’t know what’s deep inside

Just so you know, I’ll never be like you
I’ll take what God has made me
I’m not an empty shell

I’m finally awake
I feel alive today
I feel everything
It’s all so clear to me

How many times have I hated who I was
Lost sight of what defines me
‘Cause of airbrushed magazines?

But now I’ve come to cherish who I am
I’m sick and tired of taking a life that wasn’t mine

I’m alive
It’s all so clear to me
I’m alive, I’m alive
It’s all so clear to me
And I hope they see
