I'm sick of seeing this sad excuse for men  
And wives believing their figure is everything.  
We've been raised to look down,  
But my eyes will never leave the ground  

Follow the filth of who came before,  
Instead of wasting away, pick yourself from the floor.  

I don't know if you know but I'm sick of  
Every time that you disrespect yourself.  
I don't know if you know but I'm done with  
Every time that you justify the past.  

You know you make no sense with the sense you lack,  
Why don't you take those daggers out from your back  
And sharpen yourself?  
You've taken one too many times to learn  
That if you choose yourself your future gets burned,  
And you're harder to sell.  

I don't know if you know but I'm sick of  
Every time that you disrespect yourself.  
I don't know if you know but I'm done with  
Every time that you justify the past.  

Never give your sin an inch, never faulter,  
Don't begin to say your eyes have never wandered, no,  
She's still a daughter, no, she's still a daughter.  

I don't know if you know but I'm sick of  
Every time that you disrespect yourself.  
I don't know if you know but I'm done with  
Every time that you justify the past.
