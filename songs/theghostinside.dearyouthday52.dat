The second hand looks like a knife
As it's counting down the rest of our lives.
So hard to swallow,
No steps to follow,
It became so hard to survive.

Dear Youth,
What was your one big plan?
You made us believe
We had the world in our hands!
We left home
With nowhere to go,
Facing our fears as we brave the unknown!

All I have to keep
Are these jaded old memories,
From screams of how it used to be.

I once was blind,
But now I can see
That words of rationality
Were wasted on me!

So I said goodbye;
It's just a memory
That hasn't come to be.

But I recognize
That if youâ€™re on the right track
But catch the wrong train,
Nothing ends the same.

Dear Youth,
What was your one big plan?
You made us believe
We had the world in our hands!
We left home
With nowhere to go,
Facing our fears as we brave the unknown!

Dear Youth,
Put back those thoughts in my head,
The ones where I believe
That I am boundless again.
I know we're at the end of the road.
This is our story,
This was our home.

We were unbreakable!

Alive and well, the days are shrinking.
Alive and well, each moment more fleeting.
Alive and well, we gave our best.
Alive and well, you know the rest!
