It was way way back. About five generations ago, 
north of the sleepy little town of Wilkesboro. 
You can find the old Traphill area, 
Lay an hour and ten minutes south of Virginia. 

The black smith of Traphill, 
So proud of his mighty new anvil. 
He stood spindly and lean, 
Like a rattlesnake but hear he was twice as mean. 
He boasted, who here calls himself a real man? 
If you can prove it, I’ve got your cash in hand. 
If you can move my mighty hunk of steel, 
I’ll gladly give you a crisp new twenty dollar bill. 

Along came Major James Spicer, 
He was your all American, mountain of muscular. 
He was a man of hard work and humble means, 
a marble column clothed in tattered blue jeans. 
He wore a mustache like Wyatt Earp from Tombstone, 
With blue eyes that could chill a man to his very bones. 
He was known as a man of action and short temper, 
And he wasn’t going to be insulted by a horseshoe bender. 

Major said, I’m a man of just such a talent, 
So I’ll accept your foolish little challenge. 
But as sure as the pride on which you stand, 
I’m gonna move this anvil with my bare hands. 

So Major with hardly a single sound, 
Picked up the anvil right up off the ground. 
The blacksmith could barely believe his eyes to be true, 
To see his anvil being so carelessly swung round the lean to. 

Major stating, I’ve completed the task at your bidding, 
Now I believe it’s time I collected my winnings. 
The blacksmith screamed I’m not paying you a dime, 
You’ve only made me look stupid and waste my time. 
Majors face flushed red, he spun and ran out into the street, 
Blacksmith close behind screaming, someone stop that thief! 

Major had to skip town after the law was called on, 
Last anyone saw of the anvil, it was flying into the millpond.
