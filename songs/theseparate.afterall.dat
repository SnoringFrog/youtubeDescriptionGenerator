In the first place, we never cast our eyes upon the end  
So who’s to say we’ve reached the latter days?  
Could this all be the middle of the tale? 
 And the voice that brought us here is leading us  
To even further glory?   

We’ll find out what we’re made of,  
Maybe face down what we’re afraid of.  
We’ll set our sights towards home  
And take each step in stride,  
And find out what we are made of. 

  So here we are now, unprotected,  
Miles before our feet,  
Overcoming odds and ends and all the worst of elements. 
 Every measured action and every distance crossed  
Adorns a tale of even further glory.   

Optimism dies hard  
Even in a place like this. 
 It’s not dying in me.  
It’s alive in me.  
After all, wasn’t it you 
 Who sparked this fire in my chest?  
After all, wasn’t it you?  
After all, wasn’t it Progress that led us here?
